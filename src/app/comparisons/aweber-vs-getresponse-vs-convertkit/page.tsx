            Email marketing delivers an average ROI of $36 for every $1 spent — the highest
            of any marketing channel. But choosing the wrong platform means fighting your tools
            instead of growing your list. We tested all three platforms extensively to help you
            pick the right one for your business model.

              AWeber, GetResponse, and ConvertKit represent three distinct philosophies in email
              marketing. AWeber is the veteran — 25+ years in business — with deep ecommerce
              integrations and the largest template library. GetResponse has evolved into a
              full marketing automation platform with webinars, landing pages, and conversion
              funnels built in. ConvertKit (now officially &quot;Kit&quot;) was built
              specifically for creators — bloggers, YouTubers, podcasters, and course creators —
              with a focus on simplicity and deliverability.
            </p>
            <p>
              We ran parallel campaigns on all three platforms for 4 months: identical email
              sequences, similar audience segments, and the same content. We tracked open rates,
              click rates, deliverability to Gmail/Outlook, automation capabilities, and overall
              workflow efficiency. Here&apos;s what we found.

            <h2>Pricing: What You Actually Pay as You Grow</h2>
            <p>
              Email marketing pricing is subscriber-based, and costs diverge significantly as
              your list grows. The platform that&apos;s cheapest at 500 subscribers might be the
              most expensive at 50,000. Let&apos;s break down the real costs.
            </p>

            </ul>

            <h3>ConvertKit Pricing (February 2026)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Newsletter (Free):</strong> Up to 10,000 subscribers. This is by far
                the most generous free tier. Includes unlimited landing pages, forms, broadcasts,

              </li>

              </li>

                $79/mo at 3,000, $111/mo at 5,000, $167/mo at 10,000, $279/mo at 25,000.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Key insight:</strong> ConvertKit&apos;s free tier (10,000 subscribers) is
              extraordinary for creators starting out. But once you need paid features like
              automation, ConvertKit becomes the most expensive option per subscriber. AWeber
              offers the best value at scale for ecommerce. GetResponse&apos;s Marketing
              Automation tier is the best value if you factor in the webinar and funnel builder
              features that would otherwise cost $50-100/mo in separate tools.

            {/* Automation */}
            <h2>Automation: The Critical Differentiator</h2>
            <p>
              Automation is where these three platforms diverge most significantly. The quality
              of your automation directly impacts revenue — abandoned cart sequences, welcome
              series, and behavioral triggers can generate 30-50% of an email program&apos;s
              total revenue.
            </p>

            <h3>GetResponse Automation (Winner)</h3>
            <p>
              GetResponse&apos;s visual automation builder is the most capable of the three by
              a considerable margin. You get a true visual workflow builder where you can create
              complex branching logic with conditions, actions, and filters. Available triggers
              include: email opens/clicks, page visits, purchase events, tag assignments, custom
              field changes, date-based triggers, and abandonment events.
            </p>
            <p>
              What sets GetResponse apart is the depth of its conditions. You can build workflows
              that branch based on lead score, number of purchases, time since last engagement,
              geographic location, and custom data fields. Their pre-built automation templates
              (50+) cover common sequences like welcome series, lead nurturing, post-purchase
              follow-up, re-engagement campaigns, and webinar promotion.
            </p>
            <p>
              The conversion funnel feature connects landing pages, email sequences, payment
              pages, and webinars into a single automated flow. For businesses that run product
              launches or course launches, this is powerful — you can build an entire launch
              sequence (opt-in &rarr; nurture &rarr; webinar &rarr; sales page &rarr;
              post-purchase) without leaving GetResponse.
            </p>

            <h3>ConvertKit Automation</h3>
            <p>
              ConvertKit&apos;s automation is visual and intuitive, but less powerful than
              GetResponse. You can create sequences triggered by form submissions, tag
              additions, purchases, and custom events. The visual editor is clean and easy to
              understand — you can build automations in minutes, not hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              ConvertKit&apos;s strength is its tag-based subscriber management. Instead of
              managing multiple lists (like AWeber&apos;s traditional approach), ConvertKit uses
              tags and segments. Every subscriber lives in one system, and you apply tags based
              on behavior. This eliminates duplicate subscribers and makes segmentation natural.
            </p>
            <p>
              Limitation: ConvertKit&apos;s branching logic is simpler. You can do if/else
              splits based on tags, but you can&apos;t build the kind of multi-condition,
              scored-based flows that GetResponse supports.
            </p>

            <h3>AWeber Automation</h3>
            <p>
              AWeber&apos;s automation capabilities have improved significantly but still lag
              behind both competitors. Their campaign builder supports basic workflows with
              triggers (subscription, tag applied, purchase), actions (send email, wait, apply
              tag), and conditions (if/then based on opens and clicks).
            </p>
            <p>
              Where AWeber shines in automation is its ecommerce-specific features. Purchase
              tagging is automatic and detailed — when a customer buys from your Shopify or
              WooCommerce store, AWeber automatically tags them with product name, category,
              and order value. You can then build segments like &quot;bought product X but not
              product Y&quot; or &quot;customers who spent over $100&quot; and trigger automated
              campaigns to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Limitation: AWeber&apos;s visual automation builder is less intuitive than
              ConvertKit&apos;s and far less capable than GetResponse&apos;s. Complex branching
              workflows feel clunky.
            </p>

            {/* Deliverability */}
            <h2>Deliverability: Getting to the Inbox</h2>
            <p>
              Deliverability is the most important metric that most people ignore when choosing
              an email platform. If your emails land in spam, nothing else matters — not your
              subject lines, not your automation, not your templates.
            </p>
            <p>
              We ran identical campaigns (same content, same sending schedule, similar audience
              demographics) across all three platforms for 4 months and tracked inbox placement
              using Glock Apps seed list testing.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>ConvertKit: 96.8% inbox placement</strong> — Best in class. ConvertKit
                is known for strict list hygiene policies. They proactively remove cold
                subscribers and monitor sending reputation aggressively. Their text-focused
                email format (which mimics personal email) also helps bypass spam filters that
                flag heavily designed HTML emails.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>GetResponse: 94.2% inbox placement</strong> — Very good. GetResponse
                offers a deliverability consulting service on higher tiers and provides
                inbox-versus-spam analytics. Their anti-spam tools check your email content
                before sending and flag potential issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>AWeber: 93.1% inbox placement</strong> — Good, slightly below average
                for premium ESP. AWeber has historically struggled with deliverability due to
                their more permissive list import policies. They&apos;ve improved significantly,
                but ConvertKit and GetResponse still edge them out in our testing.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              All three are well above the industry average of ~85% inbox placement. The
              difference between 93% and 97% sounds small, but at 10,000 subscribers, that&apos;s
              400 more people seeing your email per send with ConvertKit. Over a year of weekly
              sends, that compounds to over 20,000 additional email impressions.

            {/* Templates and Design */}
            <h2>Templates and Email Design</h2>
            <p>
              Your approach to email design determines which platform&apos;s editor will feel
              best. This isn&apos;t just about aesthetics — it&apos;s about workflow speed and
              brand consistency.
            </p>

            <h3>AWeber: Most Templates, Most Design Control</h3>
            <p>
              AWeber offers 700+ pre-designed email templates — the largest library of the three.
              Templates span ecommerce (product launches, sales, abandoned cart), content
              (newsletters, blog digests), events, and seasonal campaigns. Their drag-and-drop
              editor is mature and feature-rich, with granular control over spacing, fonts,
              colors, borders, and mobile responsiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              For ecommerce businesses that send product-focused emails with multiple images,
              CTAs, and dynamic content blocks, AWeber&apos;s editor is the strongest. You can
              also import custom HTML templates if you have a designer on staff.
            </p>

            <h3>GetResponse: AI-Powered Design</h3>
            <p>
              GetResponse offers 200+ templates plus an AI email generator that creates complete
              email layouts based on your description. The drag-and-drop editor is excellent —
              on par with AWeber for design flexibility. Unique features include: built-in stock
              photo library (2 million+ images), countdown timers, video embedding, and product
              recommendation blocks that pull from your ecommerce store.
            </p>
            <p>
              GetResponse also offers &quot;Perfect Timing&quot; send optimization, which
              delivers each email at the time each individual subscriber is most likely to
              engage, based on their historical behavior.
            </p>

            <h3>ConvertKit: Intentionally Minimal</h3>
            <p>
              ConvertKit takes a deliberately different approach: most templates are text-focused,
              designed to look like personal emails rather than marketing broadcasts. They offer
              about 50 templates, and even the &quot;designed&quot; ones are clean and minimal.
              The editor is straightforward — you write your email, add images or buttons if
              needed, and send.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a feature, not a limitation. ConvertKit&apos;s plain-text-style emails
              consistently achieve higher open and click rates in A/B tests because they look
              like real email, not marketing. Gmail&apos;s spam filters also treat them more
              favorably. For creators and personal brands, this approach is ideal. For
              ecommerce brands that need visually rich product showcases, it&apos;s limiting.
            </p>

            {/* Landing Pages */}
            <h2>Landing Pages</h2>
            <p>
              All three platforms include landing page builders, but the quality varies
              dramatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>GetResponse</strong> leads by a wide margin with 180+ professionally
              designed landing page templates, A/B testing, countdown timers, and built-in
              analytics. Their landing pages load fast, look professional, and integrate
              seamlessly with their email automation and conversion funnels. For many
              businesses, GetResponse&apos;s landing page builder eliminates the need for a
              dedicated tool like Leadpages ($37/mo) or Unbounce ($99/mo).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>ConvertKit</strong> offers 70+ landing page templates that are clean and
              conversion-focused. They&apos;re not as design-flexible as GetResponse, but
              they load quickly and are optimized for opt-in conversions. ConvertKit also
              lets you host landing pages on your own custom domain at no extra cost.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>AWeber</strong> provides basic landing page functionality with limited
              templates and less design flexibility than either competitor. It works for simple
              opt-in pages, but if landing pages are important to your strategy, AWeber&apos;s
              offering will feel restrictive.
            </p>

            {/* Ease of Use */}
            <h2>Ease of Use: Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>ConvertKit</strong> is the easiest to learn. You can set up your account,
              create a form, and send your first email within 15 minutes. The interface is
              clean, terminology is clear, and there are no unnecessary features cluttering
              the dashboard. For non-technical creators, this simplicity is a major advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>AWeber</strong> is straightforward for basic tasks (creating emails,
              managing subscribers, setting up autoresponders) but its automation builder
              requires some learning. The interface is functional but not modern — it feels
              like a tool built in the 2010s that&apos;s been incrementally updated.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>GetResponse</strong> has the steepest learning curve because it has the
              most features. The automation workflow builder alone takes a few hours to master.
              But GetResponse provides excellent onboarding tutorials, and once you&apos;re
              familiar with the platform, the depth of functionality pays dividends. Budget
              2-3 hours for initial setup and exploration.

              <li>
                <strong>Product launchers and course creators</strong> who need end-to-end

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Agencies</strong> that need one platform to manage multiple client

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Digital product sellers</strong> who want built-in commerce (sell

            {/* Bottom Line */}
            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
              All three platforms are legitimate, well-established email marketing tools used by
              hundreds of thousands of businesses. None is objectively &quot;best&quot; — they
              each excel for different business models.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Choose AWeber</strong> if you run an ecommerce business, need the most
              templates, want the lowest cost at scale, and value phone support. AWeber&apos;s
              purchase tagging and ecommerce integrations make it the natural choice for online
              stores that rely on product-focused email campaigns.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Choose GetResponse</strong> if you want the most capable all-in-one
              platform. The combination of advanced automation, webinars, landing pages, and
              conversion funnels in a single subscription provides exceptional value. If you
              currently pay for multiple marketing tools, GetResponse can likely replace 2-3 of
              them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Choose ConvertKit</strong> if you&apos;re a creator, blogger, or
              solopreneur who values deliverability, simplicity, and building a direct
              relationship with your audience. The 10,000-subscriber free tier is unbeatable
              for starting out, and the text-focused email approach consistently outperforms
              designed emails for personal brands.
            </p>
            <p>
              Start with the free tier on whichever platform fits your model. All three offer
              no-credit-card-required free plans, so you can test the interface, build a few
              automations, and see which one feels right before committing financially.
            </p>
